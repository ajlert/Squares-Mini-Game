A simple mini game for Android.

Hello everyone, I'm a programmer with 2 years of experience in gamedev. Here is a Unity project with a source code of Squares mini game. This is just a simplified version of "Squares" game by "Simple Machine". I've made this game with the only one purpose to test my coding skills.
